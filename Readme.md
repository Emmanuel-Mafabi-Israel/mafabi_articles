# Publishing System Project 

# By Israel Mafabi Emmanuel

## Description
This project implements a basic publishing system with three main classes: 

- `Magazine`
-  `Author`
-  `Article`

The system allows magazines to keep track of their published articles and contributors, authors to manage their articles and view the magazines they have contributed to, and articles to associate authors with magazines.

## Features
- **Magazine Class**:
  - Manage a list of magazines.
  - Track published articles, article titles, contributors, and contributing authors.

- **Author Class**:
  - Manage authors' details.
  - Track articles written by the author.
  - View magazines the author has contributed to.
  - Add new articles.
  - Track topic areas the author has contributed to.

- **Article Class**:
  - Manage articles' details.
  - Track authors and magazines associated with articles.
